## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository
- Terraform >= 1.1.x
- Profit?

## Deployment / Usage

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

module "github_oidc" {
  source  = "saidsef/github-oidc/aws"
  version = "main"

  attach_read_only_policy = true
  github_organisation     = "saidsef"
  github_repositories     = [{ name = "terraform-aws-github-oidc", branches = ["main", "pr-*", "*pull*", "*"] }]
  tags                    = var.tags
}
